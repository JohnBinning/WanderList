## WanderList
An app to plan your dreams

### Instructions
First open the menu, then enter something from your bucket list.  Enter where you want to go and what you want to do - (New York - Visit the Statue of Liberty) for example.  A pin will appear on the map so you can see all of the places you want to go on the map.

You can also get past years' weather to find out if you are planning your trip during a good season to visit.
